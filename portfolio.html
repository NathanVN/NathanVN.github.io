            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Q: Why did you make the game you created? What was the inspiration?
            <br>
            <br>A: My partner and I believed that we could make a unique player vs player fighter game. Turns out, 
            <br>we were the only ones that made a 2-player game in our period, inspired by the iconic figure, Megaman!
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Q: What were two successful points in the development process of your game?
            <br>
            <br>A: I believe that two successful points in the development process of our 
            <br>game was the implementation of our sprites and configurations for the controls!
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Q: What were two obstacles in the development process of your game? How did you overcome them?
            <br>
            <br>A: One obstacle in the development of our game was the inclusion of a gravitational mechanic 
            <br>that allowed players to jump up and down To overcome this, we through a process of trial and error 
            <br>to solve this issue. Another obstacle in the development of our game was getting our menu screen to 
            <br>animate. With the help of my partner, he was able to get it working just fine through a simple loop script.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Q: What aspects of the game would you change or improve if you had more time or resorces?
            <br>
            <br>A: If my partner and I had more time, we would've definitely improved the help screen UI, as it was 
            <br>rushed in preparation of the game showcase. And if possible, add stages with more interaction such as platforms.

            <h3>Significant Algorithm</h3>
            <a><img id="mejaman" src="script.png"></a>
            <br>
            <br>This is an algorithm because it detects whether or not the player is 
            <br>inputing a specific key, in which it responds with the corresponding action. This 
            <br>algorithm applies gravity to both players, such as jumping up and down respectively.
