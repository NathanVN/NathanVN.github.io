            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Meja Man has a score to settle with his older brother, Porto Man! <br>

            <br>can finally be resolved! In this game, scores are accounted for through a health-bar system! 
            <br>To add spice to every battle, a random map of three custom-made maps are chosen to fight to the 
            <br>fullest! Although there isn't an AI that gets increasingly harder, the opponent you choose to play against 
            <br>might prove to be challenging! To win, the two players duel till one of the two players reaches zero health! </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Q: Why did you make the game you created? What was the inspiration?
            <br>
            <br>A: My partner and I believed that we could make a unique player vs player fighter game. Turns out, 
            <br>we were the only ones that made a 2-player game in our period, inspired by the iconic figure, Megaman!
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Q: What were two successful points in the development process of your game?
            <br>
            <br>A: I believe that two successful points in the development process of our 
            <br>game was the implementation of our sprites and configurations for the controls!
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Q: What were two obstacles in the development process of your game? How did you overcome them?
            <br>
            <br>A: One obstacle in the development of our game was the inclusion of a gravitational mechanic 
            <br>that allowed players to jump up and down To overcome this, we through a process of trial and error 
            <br>to solve this issue. Another obstacle in the development of our game was getting our menu screen to 
            <br>animate. With the help of my partner, he was able to get it working just fine through a simple loop script.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Q: What aspects of the game would you change or improve if you had more time or resorces?
            <br>
            <br>A: If my partner and I had more time, we would've definitely improved the help screen UI, as it was 
            <br>rushed in preparation of the game showcase. And if possible, add stages with more interaction such as platforms.

            <h3>Significant Algorithm</h3>
            <a><img id="mejaman" src="script.png"></a>
            <br>
            <br>This is an algorithm because it detects whether or not the player is 
            <br>inputing a specific key, in which it responds with the corresponding action. This 
            <br>algorithm applies gravity to both players, such as jumping up and down respectively.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Will you choose to complete the Pokédex or become the next Pokémon champion?
            <br>Through this CYOA, the player will be able to choose their own Pokémon, battle their rival, 
            <br>and become the next Pokémon champion! However, it will not be easy. As this CYOA follows the 
            <br>storyline of a generic Pokémon game with actual implementation of the battle system from Pokémon!
            <br>This means that the player will need the knowledge to battle their way to the top through several Pokémon battles!

            <h3>Incremental and Iterative Development</h3>
            <p>When working on this CYOA, one of the incremental processes we had to go through was tediously 
            <br>recreating a different scene for each battle. We had to add each option and outcome piece by piece 
            <br>until each Pokémon battle was unique and eventually resulted in another Pokémon battle to initiate.
            <br>Most of the incremental development was done by my partner. On the other hand, most of the iterative
            <br>development was done by me. I developed most of the dialogue and mechanics of the game, which required
            <br>many instances where I had to call each function over and over until it all fell into place and worked
            <br>the way I wanted it to work. Such as making sure the dialogue didn't randomly cut off or making sure that
            <br>the option choosen by the player would result into the desired outcome. Difficulties I encountered while
            <br>developing this game was an issue of a scene not linking to the next scene that was supposed to occur after.
            <br>To fix this, my partner made the code easier and more organized by using less lines and simple IDs. Through
            <br>that, I was able to affix the dialogue to each scene properly and eventually each scene stopped breaking.
            <br>An oppurtunity we found when developing the game was asking the amazing Ms. Berry, who helped us by providing
            <br>a method to keep data that the player had influenced at the beginning of the story to later be recalled in another scene.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Procedural Abstraction</h3>
            <p>Organizing our story scenes into functions are a form of procedural abraction because it separates each scene
            <br>into its own function, simplifying the process of creating this CYOA by reducing complexity and making the process 
            <br>more efficient. The advantages of abstracting our scenes into functions are that it helps us puts each function into
            <br>pieces that are far less confusing to code than one singular block of code that can be hard to follow if not coded all 
            <br>at once.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Personally, I liked the book "The Reason I Jump" by Naoki Higashida because he conveys how it's like to live with autism
            <br>and gave me a unique perspective through his eyes.</p>
